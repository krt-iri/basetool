# Frontend AJAX mutations — krtFetch, krtCsrf & fragment swaps

## Context & goal

Working with data in the `frontend` module must not reload the page. Every create / update / delete
/ toggle / reorder / filter / paginate interaction updates the DOM **in place** through one shared
client foundation, so users keep scroll and focus and the app ships a small payload per edit instead
of re-rendering the whole document. This spec is the durable contract behind epic #571; the
architecture decision (and the rejected alternatives — htmx, cookie-CSRF, app-wide Alpine) is
ADR-0012. Phase 0 (#572) builds the foundation + exemplars; per-area conversions are the epic's
child issues (#573–#582).

The foundation lives in [`krt-fetch.js`](../../frontend/src/main/resources/static/js/krt-fetch.js),
loaded globally from `fragments/head.html`. It exposes `window.krtFetch` (`write`, `swap`,
`syncVersion`) and `window.krtCsrf` (`headers`, `token`, `refresh`). The toast/confirm infrastructure
(`showFrontendSuccessToast`, `showFrontendErrorToast`, `showKrtConfirm`) is the design-system-mandated
replacement for native dialogs (see [`ui-design-system.md`](ui-design-system.md)).

## Requirements

### REQ-FE-001 — No full-page reload on a successful mutation

A create / update / delete / toggle / reorder interaction must update only the changed DOM nodes and
must not navigate the document (no `window.location.reload()`, no redirect-follow) on success. The
**only** sanctioned reload is the optimistic-lock conflict path, where the user explicitly accepts a
reload via `showKrtConfirm`.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] After the action, the URL and document are unchanged and the affected node(s) reflect the new
  state (badges, totals and status cells re-derived in the success handler, not by a reload).
- [ ] No `location.reload()` runs on the success path; the only reload is a user-accepted
  optimistic-lock confirm.

**Enforced by:** per-area Playwright e2e (no-navigation assertion) · **Code:** `krt-fetch.js`,
the converted page handlers · **Issues:** #571, #572

### REQ-FE-002 — All writes go through `krtFetch` + `krtCsrf`

Mutations use `krtFetch.write(...)`; no page may hand-roll a `fetch` write or a CSRF-header read.
`krtCsrf` is the single source of truth, reading the freshest `meta[name="_csrf"]` /
`meta[name="_csrf_header"]` tags. Hard-coded header names (e.g. the former `members.html`
`X-CSRF-TOKEN`) are forbidden.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] A new write call site uses `krtFetch.write` / `krtCsrf.headers()` — no bespoke CSRF block.
- [ ] No template or JS hard-codes the CSRF header name.

**Enforced by:** code review + grep guard in review · **Code:** `krt-fetch.js` · **Issues:** #572

### REQ-FE-003 — `syncVersion` propagates the optimistic-lock version

On a successful write whose response carries a `version`, `krtFetch` writes that value to the
target container **and every descendant `[data-version]`**, so the user's next action on the same
aggregate sends the fresh version and does not 409. When propagation cannot be made complete in
place, the handler reloads deliberately (the conflict-confirm path) rather than leaving a stale
version. This is the client half of the `@Version` rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] A second consecutive action on the same row/aggregate after a successful write does not
  produce a 409.
- [ ] All related `[data-version]` attributes in the DOM context hold the new version after success.

**Enforced by:** per-area e2e "double-action" assertion · **Code:** `krt-fetch.js` (`syncVersion`)
· **Issues:** #571

### REQ-FE-004 — CSRF stays session/meta-based with transparent retry-on-403

The CSRF token repository and handler are unchanged (`HttpSessionCsrfTokenRepository` +
`XorCsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler`). An authenticated `GET /csrf` returns `{headerName, token}`.
On a bare `403` from a write, `krtFetch` refetches the token once, updates the `_csrf` meta tags,
and retries the request exactly once before surfacing the error. `/csrf` rejects anonymous callers
(it sits under the `authenticated()` catch-all). This is additive, not a binding security-model
change (ADR-0012).

**Acceptance**

- [ ] `GET /csrf` returns the current header name + token for an authenticated session and does not
  serve an anonymous caller a token.
- [ ] A write with a stale token succeeds after exactly one transparent token-refresh + retry; a
  genuinely failing write still surfaces its error (no infinite retry).

**Enforced by:** `CsrfTokenControllerMvcTest` + forced-stale-token e2e · **Code:**
`CsrfTokenController`, `krt-fetch.js` (`krtCsrf.refresh`, retry path) · **Issues:** #572

### REQ-FE-005 — Lists / filters / pagination are in-place fragment swaps

Filtering, sorting and paginating a list use `krtFetch.swap`, which loads the controller's
`?fragment=results` HTML fragment into the results container and intercepts in-container pagination
/ sort anchors (`a.page-btn[href]` and opted-in `a[data-swap][href]`) so paging stays in place. This
fixes the regression where pagination anchors inside an AJAX results container triggered a full
navigation while filtering did not.

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Changing a filter swaps the results without navigating.
- [ ] Clicking a pagination/sort control inside the results container swaps in place (no full page
  load) and preserves the active filter query.

**Enforced by:** lists/pagination e2e (#573) · **Code:** `krt-fetch.js` (`swap`), `missions.js`,
`operations.js`, `fragments/pagination.html` · **Issues:** #572, #573

## Out of scope

- The per-area conversions themselves (one issue per area, #573–#582) — this spec is the contract
  they each satisfy, not the work list.
- Switching the CSRF token repository to cookie-based, and adopting htmx or app-wide Alpine — all
  explicitly rejected in ADR-0012.
- WebSocket / live-collaboration changes beyond the existing `mission-presence.js`.
- Backend business-logic changes beyond adding JSON proxy endpoints that reuse existing backend
  APIs/DTOs.

## Open questions

- None open. The `MissionSubresource` alias in `krt-fetch.js` is transitional; mission-detail is
  migrated to call `krtFetch` directly in the Missions child (#574), after which the alias is
  removed.
